# User Management Application

A React-based application for managing users. This application allows you to view, add, edit, and delete users while interacting with the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for demonstration purposes. 

## Features

- **View Users**: Displays a list of users fetched from the API.
- **Add Users**: Allows adding a new user through a form and updates the user list.
- **Edit Users**: Modify existing user details and save changes.
- **Delete Users**: Remove a user from the list with a confirmation alert.
- **Pagination**: Handles displaying users in chunks for better usability.
- **Client-side Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled before submitting the form.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop views.

## Technologies Used

- React (with Hooks)
- Axios (for API requests)
- CSS (for styling)
